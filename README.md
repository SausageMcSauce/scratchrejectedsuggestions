[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SausageMcSauce/scratchrejectedsuggestions)](https://repl.it/github/SausageMcSauce/scratchrejectedsuggestions)

Some tool to display items from Scratch's [official list of rejected suggestions](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/343602/), including BBCode, that can be copied and pasted into Scratch forum posts.

All contents of the list were written by the creator of that forum topic.

Documentation coming soon.

This is currently a work in progress.

If you download this repository, you can remove all files except main.py and tolorslist.py.
