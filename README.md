[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SausageMcSauce/scratchrejectedsuggestions)](https://repl.it/github/SausageMcSauce/scratchrejectedsuggestions)

Some tool to display items from Scratch's [official list of rejected suggestions](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/343602/), including BBCode, that can be copied and pasted into Scratch forum posts.

All contents of the list were written by the creator of that forum topic.

Documentation coming soon.
